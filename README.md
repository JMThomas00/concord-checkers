# Checkers

A [Concord](https://github.com/JMThomas00/Concord) plugin that's also a
standalone program.

## Run it

```sh
go run .
```

Launched by a Concord server, the same program joins that server as a
plugin instead (Concord sets `CONCORD_WS_URL` and friends; see
`plugin.ConfigFromEnv`).

## Install it on a Concord server

In Concord, open **Server Settings → Plugins**, press **I**, and enter
`github.com/JMThomas00/concord-checkers` without the `github.com/` (or paste the repo's URL). Concord
downloads the latest release for its own OS and CPU, checks it against the
checksum GitHub publishes, and starts it. No restart, no config files.
Settings then live under **Enter** on the plugin.

## Release a version

```sh
git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags
```

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds every target with `go run release.go`
and attaches `dist/concord-checkers_<os>_<arch>.zip` to the release. Run
`go run release.go` locally to check the zips.

## How it fits together

- `plugin.toml`: what Concord reads: the channel type this plugin adds, its
  settings (shown as a form in Server Settings; never hand-edited), and
  which binary to start on each OS.
- `main.go`: standalone vs plugin, and the plugin's behaviour, built on the
  Concord SDK (`github.com/JMThomas00/Concord/sdk`).
